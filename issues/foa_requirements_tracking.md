# Add Requirements Tracking to FOA/Call for Proposals

**Description:**
The UDM should be updated to capture requirements information for Funding Opportunity Announcements (FOA) or Call for Proposals. This would allow tracking of specific requirements from the solicitation documents.

**Proposed Changes:**
Add a `Requirements` column (or related fields) to the relevant entity that could capture:
- Page number references from the FOA document
- Specific requirement text or summary
- Requirement category/type
- Compliance status tracking

**Use Case:**
When reviewing FOAs, users need to track specific requirements from the solicitation (e.g., "Page 12: Budget justification required for equipment over $5,000"). This enables better compliance tracking during proposal development and post-award management.

**Affected Entities:**
- Review which entity best captures FOA/solicitation data
- May need new entity or extension of existing Award/Proposal entity

**Status:** Pending review

**Requested by:** Lakehouse team (via PostAward module development)
